    name: 'Wheat Rust',
    description:
    'Wheat Rust is a fungal disease that appears as orange-brown pustules '
        'on leaves and stems of wheat plants. It spreads rapidly in warm, humid '
        'conditions and can cause significant yield loss if left untreated. '
        'It is one of the most destructive wheat diseases worldwide.',
    solution:
    '• Apply fungicides such as Propiconazole or Tebuconazole early.\n'
        '• Remove and destroy infected plant debris.\n'
        '• Use rust-resistant wheat varieties.\n'
        '• Ensure proper spacing for air circulation.\n'
        '• Monitor fields weekly during humid weather.',

  Disease(
    name: 'Leaf Blight',
    description:
    'Leaf Blight causes rapid browning and death of leaf tissue. '
        'It is typically caused by fungal or bacterial pathogens and thrives '
        'in wet, warm environments. Affected leaves show water-soaked spots '
        'that quickly turn brown and dry out, leading to premature defoliation.',
    solution:
    '• Use copper-based bactericides or fungicides.\n'
        '• Avoid overhead irrigation; use drip irrigation instead.\n'
        '• Remove infected leaves immediately.\n'
        '• Apply neem oil as an organic solution.\n'
        '• Rotate crops each season to break disease cycles.',
    iconEmoji: '🍂',
    severity: 'Medium',
    color: '#8B4513',

  Disease(
    name: 'Powdery Mildew',
    description:
    'Powdery Mildew appears as white or gray powdery spots on leaf surfaces. '
        'It is caused by various fungal species and thrives in dry weather with '
        'high humidity. It weakens plants by blocking photosynthesis, leading '
        'to yellowing, stunted growth, and reduced crop yield.',
    solution:
    '• Spray potassium bicarbonate or sulfur-based fungicide.\n'
        '• Apply diluted neem oil spray weekly.\n'
        '• Ensure good airflow between plants.\n'
        '• Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilizers.\n'
        '• Plant resistant varieties when available.',

  Disease(
    name: 'Root Rot',
    description:
    'Root Rot is caused by waterlogged soil conditions that promote '
        'fungal growth around the root system. Affected plants show wilting, '
        'yellowing leaves, and stunted growth despite adequate water. '
        'The roots appear dark, mushy, and have a foul smell.',
    solution:
    '• Improve soil drainage immediately.\n'
        '• Reduce watering frequency significantly.\n'
        '• Apply Trichoderma-based bio-fungicide to the soil.\n'
        '• Uproot and destroy severely affected plants.\n'
        '• Avoid waterlogging by raised-bed cultivation.',
    iconEmoji: '🪴',
    severity: 'High',

  Disease(
    name: 'Healthy Leaf',
    description:
    'This leaf shows no signs of disease or pest damage. '
        'The plant appears to be in excellent health with vibrant green color, '
        'firm texture, and no discoloration or spots. '
        'Continue with current care routine to maintain plant health.',
    solution:
    '• Continue regular watering schedule.\n'
        '• Maintain balanced fertilization (NPK).\n'
        '• Monitor weekly for early signs of disease.\n'
        '• Ensure proper sunlight exposure.\n'
        '• Keep the field clean from weeds.',

  Disease(
    name: 'Yellow Mosaic Virus',
    description:
    'Yellow Mosaic Virus is a viral disease transmitted by whiteflies. '
        'It causes a mosaic pattern of yellow and green patches on leaves, '
        'leading to stunted growth and reduced productivity. '
        'There is no cure once a plant is infected, so prevention is key.',
    solution:
    '• Control whitefly population using yellow sticky traps.\n'
        '• Spray insecticides like Imidacloprid to kill vectors.\n'
        '• Remove and burn infected plants immediately.\n'
        '• Use virus-resistant seed varieties.\n'
        '• Avoid planting near infected fields.',
